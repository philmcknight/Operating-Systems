One operating system function from Windows 10 is the Start Button. It was brought back from an early grave. That button allows you to shut off the device, or log off, and it also gives you access to all of your other programs on the computer.
Another feature of Windows 10 is Cortana. Similar to Siri on Apple Devices, it is a computer voice assistant that can help you look up files on your computer. This is helpful for needle in a haystack scenarios.
The Edge operating system is a great feature of Windows 10. It's built on the open source Chromium code which powers other web browsers like Google Chrome. The big benefit is, the extensions you have downloaded for Google Chrome are also compatible with Edge.
